# guessing-game
 This is a guessing game where user have to guess a number and has limited amount of attempts to do it
 User is choosing the range in which his number to guess will be. First user provides the lower bound, then the upper bound. After it, the user sees how many attempts they have, and then they start the guessing game! If the number they provide is lower, they 
 will receive the message that the number they guessed is too low. If they guess a number too high, they will get a message that their number is too high. When the user guesses the number (in the number of attempts), they will receive congratulations and information on how 
 much attempts, they needed to guess their number. If user doesn't guess their number, they will see the message "Better luck next time!" and what their number was.
